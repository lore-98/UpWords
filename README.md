# UpWords
Upwords is a letter tile word game similar to Scrabble, with players building words using letter tiles on a gridded game board. Unlike Scrabble, in Upwords letters can be stacked on top of existing words to create new words. Scoring is determined by the number of letter tiles stacked in a new word.
